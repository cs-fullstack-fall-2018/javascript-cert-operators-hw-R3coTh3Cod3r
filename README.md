What did you learn about comparing class objects?
What learned that in order to have two strings to equal to one another they must have the same amount of characters and length in the same position. For example, if printed on the console.log it must be like "console.log('hello'=='hello') " which make the outcome true. Also that strict strings can only be paired with same object.
